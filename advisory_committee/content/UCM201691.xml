Pharmacogenomics examines the genetic differences that influence a person&amp;rsquo;s responses, both beneficial and harmful, to certain drugs; (2) a new patient-centric clinical pharmacology approach to drug safety; (3) the design and analysis of clinical pharmacology studies focusing on how the renal function changes in the way the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and excretes a drug in patients with kidney impairment; (4) scientific considerations and recent developments in transporter-mediated drug interactions. These interactions are between two or more drugs that either inhibit or enhance the roles of specialized proteins known as &amp;ldquo;transporters&amp;rdquo; and, in turn, the interactions can affect a drug&amp;rsquo;s safety and/or efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','ucm201700.htm')--]"&gt;2010 Meeting Materials, Pharmaceutical Science and Clinical Pharmacology Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.
