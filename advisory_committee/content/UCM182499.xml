  <wcm:element name="MainContent">&lt;div&gt;This notice announces a forthcoming meeting of a public advisory&lt;br /&gt;committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The meeting will&lt;br /&gt;be open to the public.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Name of Committee: Hematology and Pathology Devices Panel of the&lt;br /&gt;Medical Devices Advisory Committee.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;General Function of the Committee: To provide advice and&lt;br /&gt;recommendations to the agency on FDA's regulatory issues.&lt;br /&gt;Date and Time: The meeting will be held on October 22 and 23, 2009,&lt;br /&gt;from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Location: Hilton Washington DC North/Gaithersburg, Salons A, B, and&lt;br /&gt;C, 620 Perry Pkwy., Gaithersburg, MD.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Contact Person: Louise E. Magruder, Center for Devices and&lt;br /&gt;Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993, 301-796-6175, or FDA Advisory Committee&lt;br /&gt;Information Line, 1-800-741-8138 (301-443-0572 in the Washington, DC&lt;br /&gt;area), code 3014512515. Please call the Information Line for up-to-date&lt;br /&gt;information on this meeting. A notice in the Federal Register about&lt;br /&gt;last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory&lt;br /&gt;committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide&lt;br /&gt;timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the agency's Web site&lt;br /&gt;and call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone line to&lt;br /&gt;learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agenda: On October 22 and 23, 2009, the committee will discuss and&lt;br /&gt;make recommendations on public health issues related to the use of&lt;br /&gt;digital whole slide imaging systems to replace conventional light&lt;br /&gt;microscopy for diagnostic surgical pathology. In the scope of this&lt;br /&gt;meeting, digital pathology is defined as converting what can be&lt;br /&gt;observed by conventional light microscopy on histologic glass slides&lt;br /&gt;into digital whole slide images via digital scanners; viewing these&lt;br /&gt;images via a computer monitor to render pathologic diagnosis of the&lt;br /&gt;lesion of interest; and digitally archiving and retrieving these&lt;br /&gt;images. The committee will not be discussing computer-assisted image&lt;br /&gt;analysis or remote real-time microscopy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no&lt;br /&gt;later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post&lt;br /&gt;the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the&lt;br /&gt;background material will be made publicly available at the location of&lt;br /&gt;the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be&lt;br /&gt;posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting. Background material is&lt;br /&gt;available on the FDA Internet under the appropriate date at http://&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.com" href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.com"&gt;www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.com&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to the&lt;br /&gt;appropriate advisory committee link.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Procedure: Interested persons may present data, information, or&lt;br /&gt;views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;br /&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before&lt;br /&gt;October 15, 2009. Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled&lt;br /&gt;between approximately 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. each day. Those desiring to&lt;br /&gt;make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and&lt;br /&gt;submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or&lt;br /&gt;arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed&lt;br /&gt;participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to&lt;br /&gt;make their presentation on or before October 1, 2009. Time allotted for&lt;br /&gt;each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants&lt;br /&gt;requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated&lt;br /&gt;during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a&lt;br /&gt;lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing&lt;br /&gt;session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by October&lt;br /&gt;8, 2009.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Persons attending FDA's advisory committee meetings are advised&lt;br /&gt;that the agency is not responsible for providing access to electrical&lt;br /&gt;outlets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FDA welcomes the attendance of the public at its advisory committee&lt;br /&gt;meetings and will make every effort to accommodate persons with&lt;br /&gt;physical disabilities or special needs. If you require special&lt;br /&gt;accommodations due to a disability, please contact AnnMarie Williams,&lt;br /&gt;Conference Management Staff, 301-796-5966, at least 7 days in advance&lt;br /&gt;of the meeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FDA is committed to the orderly conduct of its advisory committee&lt;br /&gt;meetings.
