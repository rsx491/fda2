&lt;h4&gt;Agenda&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science Board will hear about and discuss a final report from its subcommittee reviewing research at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The Science Board will also hear about an interim report from the subcommittee to review the Pharmacovigilance Program at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The Science Board will then hear and discuss JANUS, FDA supported Data Standard Comparative Effectiveness Research, and FDA’s nanotechnology research program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make the complete background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background material&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','ucm198503.htm')--]"&gt;2010 Meeting Materials, Science Board to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Participation and Sponsor Information&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested persons and Sponsors (representatives from industry) may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before August 9, 2010. Comments received on or before August 2, will be provided to the committee before the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public (excluding Sponsors) will be scheduled between approximately 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on August 16, 2010. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before August 2, 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by August 3, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
