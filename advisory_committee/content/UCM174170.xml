A notice in the Federal Register about last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the agency's Web site and call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="106"&gt;Agenda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="518"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 18, 2009, the committee will discuss, make recommendations and vote on a premarket approval application (PMA) for the CoMplete Acetabular Hip System, sponsored by DePuy Orthopaedics. This device system is intended for use as a primary joint replacement prosthesis in total hip arthroplasty, and is indicated for skeletally mature patients suffering severe pain and disability due to structural damage in the hip joint from non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease and its composite diagnoses of osteoarthritis or post-traumatic arthritis. On August 19, 2009, the committee will discuss, make recommendations and vote on a PMA for Durolane, sponsored by Q-Med AB. This device is indicated for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacological therapy and simple analgesics, e.g., acetaminophen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="106"&gt;Procedure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width="518"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procedure: Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee. Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before August 4, 2009. Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled at approximately 1 p.m., immediately following lunch on both days. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before July 27, 2009. Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by July 28, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons attending FDA's advisory committee meetings are advised that the agency is not responsible for providing access to electrical outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FDA welcomes the attendance of the public at its advisory committee meetings and will make every effort to accommodate persons with physical disabilities or special needs.
