The Wingspan Stent System with Gateway PTA Balloon Catheter is a neurovascular stent, balloon catheter, and delivery system consisting of the following components: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Wingspan Stent--This is a self-expanding, nitinol stent with a tubular mesh design.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Gateway PTA Balloon Catheter--This balloon catheter is used to predilate the lesion prior to introduction of the Wingspan Stent System into the patient.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Wingspan Delivery System--This delivery system is a single lumen, over-the-wire, coaxial microcatheter that is used to deliver the stent to the treatment site within the patient's artery.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wingspan Stent System with Gateway PTA Balloon Catheter has been approved under a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) (H050001) for the following indications: &amp;quot;The Wingspan Stent System with Gateway PTA Balloon Catheter is indicated for use in improving cerebral artery lumen diameter in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease, refractory to medical therapy, in intracranial vessels with &amp;ge; 50% stenosis that are accessible to the system.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Interim results and analyses of data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial, &amp;quot;Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (SAMMPRIS), published in the &lt;u&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt; (2011;365:993-1003), will be presented for the Wingspan Stent with Gateway PTA Balloon catheter.&amp;nbsp; The committee will be asked to discuss the comparability of the patient populations for the approved HDE and SAMMPRIS trial and the relevance of the SAMMPRIS trial results to the assessment of safety and probable benefit for the Wingspan Stent System with Gateway PTA Balloon Catheter HDE. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FDA recently received a citizen's petition seeking withdrawal of the HDE approval and recall of Wingspan stents currently on the market.&amp;nbsp; The petitions are available for public review and comment at &lt;a href="[!--$ssExternalLink('UCM061391')--]" target="_blank"&gt;www.regulations.gov&lt;/a&gt; under docket number FDA-2011-P-0923. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&amp;nbsp; Background material is available at &lt;a href="[!--$ssExternalLink('UCM291569')--]" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to the appropriate advisory committee link.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;Procedure&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; FDA will work with affected industry and professional organizations that have an interest in the Wingspan Stent System and who wish to make a presentation separate from the general Open Public Hearing; time slots between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. are provided.&amp;nbsp; Representatives from industry and professionals organizations interested in making formal presentations to the committee should notify the contact person on or before March 1, 2012. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&amp;nbsp; Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before March 9, 2012.&amp;nbsp; Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 11 a.m. and 12 p.m.&amp;nbsp; Those individuals interested in making formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before March 1, 2012.&amp;nbsp; Time allotted for each presentation may be limited.&amp;nbsp; If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session.&amp;nbsp; The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by March 2, 2012.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Persons attending FDA's advisory committee meetings are advised that the Agency is not responsible for providing access to electrical outlets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; FDA welcomes the attendance of the public at its advisory committee meetings and will make every effort to accommodate persons with physical disabilities or special needs.
