On July 10, 2013, the Agency plans to discuss the risk management of Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride) tablets, Prometheus Laboratories Inc., which is approved for the treatment of women with severe diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-d). The Agency will seek the committee&amp;rsquo;s comments as to whether the REMS with ETASU for this drug assures safe use, is not unduly burdensome to patient access to the drug, and to the extent practicable, minimizes the burden to the health care delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Background Material:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul sizcache="1" sizset="37"&gt;&lt;li sizcache="1" sizset="37"&gt;&lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM332858')--]"&gt;2013 Meeting Materials, Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="noindent" sizcache="5" sizset="27"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before June 25, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on July 10, 2013. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before June 17, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by June&amp;nbsp;18, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p sizcache="1" sizset="38"&gt;CDER plans to provide a free of charge, live webcast of the July 10, 2013, meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
