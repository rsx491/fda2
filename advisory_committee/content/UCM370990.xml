The need for suitable outcome assessment tools to evaluate treatment benefit of new cancer drugs on how a patient feels and/or functions as well as survives necessitates consideration of the potential challenges to the use of patient reported outcomes (PROs) in the pediatric age group. The 2009 &amp;ldquo;FDA Guidance for Industry: Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims&amp;rdquo; does not specifically address the relevance and potential use of such measures in the pediatric development plans of oncology products. The half-day session will provide an opportunity to review the Agency&amp;rsquo;s position on the use of PROs in the pediatric population in general. As well, participants will review the current state of the science of the evaluation of pertinent health-related quality of life measures in children with cancer across the various age and developmental subgroups of children. Participants will discuss potential contexts of use for measuring both observable and unobservable concepts in specific pediatric cancer diagnoses across relevant age groups and defined disease stages using validated tools. No specific drug or biologic products or class of products will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul sizset="37" sizcache="1"&gt;&lt;li sizset="37" sizcache="1"&gt;&lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM341089')--]"&gt;2013 Meeting Materials, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="noindent"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before October&amp;nbsp;30, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 2:45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before October 28, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by October 29, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p sizset="38" sizcache="1"&gt;CDER plans to provide a free of charge, live webcast of the November 4, 2013, meeting of the Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee.
