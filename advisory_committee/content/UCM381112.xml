&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will discuss new drug application (NDA) 204958, cangrelor injection, submitted by The Medicines Company, for the proposed indication of reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events including stent thrombosis (events related to blood clots in a stent, a device inserted to keep the artery open) in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI refers to the opening of narrowed blood vessels supplying the heart muscle by a balloon inserted through an artery puncture with or without a stent. The applicant is also proposing that cangrelor be indicated to maintain P2Y12 inhibition in patients with acute coronary syndromes or patients with stents who are at increased risk for thrombotic events (such as stent thrombosis) when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery. P2Y12 is a protein involved in blood clotting; inhibiting this protein is a key mechanism of action of cangrelor.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
