This formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules represents the first single-entity (i.e., containing no other active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) hydrocodone-containing drug product. It will be formulated in dose strengths up to 50 mg, and administered twice daily (i.e., every 12 hours). The committee will be asked to determine whether the benefit-risk assessment of this product favors its approval for marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Background Material&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul sizcache="5" sizset="26"&gt;&lt;li sizcache="1" sizset="36"&gt;&lt;a target="" href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/AnestheticAndAnalgesicDrugProductsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm283971.htm"&gt;2012 Meeting Materials, Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul sizcache="5" sizset="27"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before November 23, 2012.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. on December 7, 2012.
