&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;The committee will discuss new drug application (NDA) 206031, drisapersen solution for injection, sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., for the treatment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with mutations in the dystrophin gene that are amenable to treatment with exon 51 skipping as determined by genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting. Background material is available at: &lt;a id="anch_32" target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM467181')--]"&gt;2015 Meeting Materials, Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before November 9, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 12:40 p.m. to 2:40 p.m. on November 24, 2015. Those individuals interested in making formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before October 30, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by November 2, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;CDER plans to provide a free of charge, live webcast of the November 24, 2015 meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee. While CDER is working to make webcasts available to the public for all advisory committee meetings held at the White Oak campus, there are instances where the webcast transmission is not successful; staff will work to re-establish the transmission as soon as possible. Further information regarding the webcast, including the web address for the webcast, will be made available at least 2 days in advance of the meeting at the following website: &lt;a id="anch_32" target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM467181')--]"&gt;2015 Meeting Materials, Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin: 1em 0px"&gt;CDER plans to post archived webcasts after the meeting, however, in cases where transmission was not successful, archived webcasts will not be available.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
