&lt;h4&gt;Agenda&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June, 4, 2014, the Science Board will discuss and make recommendations on the draft final report from CBER's post-marketing safety review subcommittee. The committee will be asked to support forming a new subcommittee to evaluate the Commissioner's Fellowship Program. The committee will be presented with an overview of current issues surrounding heparin sourcing for discussion. A recipient of one of the FY2013 Scientific Achievement Awards (selected by the Board) will provide an overview of the activities for which the award was given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make the complete background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background material&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
