Those desiring to make formal oral presentations, including those who had previously requested time to speak at the originally scheduled March 7, 2013 Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before April 1, 2013. Any individuals who requested time to speak at the originally scheduled March 7, 2013 Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, will need to follow the instructions in this document to request time to speak at the April 17, 2013 Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, as any previous requests to speak at the originally scheduled meeting do not convey to this new April 17, 2013 Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session.
