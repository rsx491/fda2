IMPROVE-IT was a clinical trial that studied the effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin compared with simvastatin on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome. The results from this trial have been submitted to support supplemental new drug applications 21445/S-038 and 21687/S-054, ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) tablets, respectively, by MSD International GmbH. The proposed indication for ZETIA (in combination with a statin) and VYTORIN is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.

If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session.
