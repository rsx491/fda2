(Myelosuppression is a reduction of blood cell production, which can be caused by radiation exposure.) Currently approved LGFs are licensed under biological license applications (BLAs): 103353, NEUPOGEN (filgrastim, Amgen, Inc.), 125031, NEULASTA (pegfilgrastim, Amgen, Inc.), 103362, LEUKINE (sargramostim, Genzyme, Inc.), and 125294, TBO-FILGRASTIM (tbo-filgrastim, Sicor Biotech, UAB). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has submitted efficacy data for filgrastim, based on treatment in an animal model of radiation-induced myelosuppression. Safety and other supportive information are currently described in the labeling for LGFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Background Material:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul sizcache="1" sizset="37"&gt;&lt;li sizcache="1" sizset="37"&gt;&lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM334176')--]"&gt;2013 Meeting Materials, Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="noindent" sizcache="5" sizset="27"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before April 19, 2013.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on May 3, 2013.
