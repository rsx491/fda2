Please call the Information Line for up-to-date information on this meeting. A notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER about last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the agency&amp;rsquo;s Web site and call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="15%"&gt;Agenda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The committee will discuss, make recommendations and vote on a premarket approval application for the SEDASYS&amp;trade; Computer-Assisted Personalized Sedation System sponsored by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. The device is indicated for the intravenous administration of 1% (10 mg/mL) propofol injectable emulsion for the initiation and maintenance of minimal to moderate sedation, as identified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Continuum of Depth of Sedation, in adult patients (American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I, II, or III) undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedures. FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="15%"&gt;Procedure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.

Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before May 6, 2009.
