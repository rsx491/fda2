Washington, DC area), code 3014512397. Please call the Information Line for&lt;br /&gt;
up-to-date information on this meeting. A notice in the Federal Register about&lt;br /&gt;
last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide&lt;br /&gt;
timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the agency’s Web site and&lt;br /&gt;
call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone line to learn about&lt;br /&gt;
possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Agenda: On January 25, 2010, the committee will discuss guidance&lt;br /&gt;
documents issued since the last meeting. The committee will also receive&lt;br /&gt;
updates on: Interventional mammography accreditation programs, recently&lt;br /&gt;
approved alternative standards, facility inspection findings, the status of&lt;br /&gt;
current inspection followup actions, and the radiological health program.&lt;br /&gt;
FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later&lt;br /&gt;
than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the&lt;br /&gt;
background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background&lt;br /&gt;
material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web&lt;br /&gt;
site after the meeting. Background material is available at http://www.fda.gov/&lt;br /&gt;
AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm. Scroll down to the appropriate&lt;br /&gt;
advisory committee link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Procedure: Interested persons may present data, information, or views,&lt;br /&gt;
orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee. Written&lt;br /&gt;
submissions may be made to the contact person on or before January 4, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately&lt;br /&gt;
9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations&lt;br /&gt;
should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general&lt;br /&gt;
nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and&lt;br /&gt;
addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time&lt;br /&gt;
requested to make their presentation on or before December 28, 2009. Time&lt;br /&gt;
allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants&lt;br /&gt;
requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during&lt;br /&gt;
the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to&lt;br /&gt;
determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The&lt;br /&gt;
contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak&lt;br /&gt;
by December 29, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
