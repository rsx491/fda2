The postmarketing studies are intended to be epidemiological or observational studies that will assess the known serious risks of these products and whether product-specific properties which are intended to deter misuse and abuse actually result in a decrease in the risks of misuse and abuse, and their consequences: addiction, overdose, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.
