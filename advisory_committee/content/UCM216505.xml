Line, 1–800–741–8138 (301–443–0572 in the Washington, DC area), code&lt;br /&gt;
3014512396. Please call the Information Line for up-to-date information on this&lt;br /&gt;
meeting. A notice in the Federal Register about last minute modifications that&lt;br /&gt;
impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be&lt;br /&gt;
published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should&lt;br /&gt;
always check the agency’s Web site and call the appropriate advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee hot line/phone line to learn about possible modifications before&lt;br /&gt;
coming to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Agenda: On July 30, 2010, the committee will discuss, make&lt;br /&gt;
recommendations, and vote on a premarket approval application for the&lt;br /&gt;
Glaukos iStent Trabecular Micro-Bypass Stent, Model GTS–100 L/R, sponsored&lt;br /&gt;
by Glaukos Corp. The device is indicated for use in conjunction with cataract&lt;br /&gt;
surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in subjects with mild&lt;br /&gt;
to moderate open-angle glaucoma currently treated with ocular hypotensive&lt;br /&gt;
medication. For this device, the patients should have normal gonioscopic&lt;br /&gt;
anatomy and a visually significant cataract eligible for phacoemulsification.&lt;br /&gt;
The patient’s glaucoma should be considered mild to moderate Primary Open&lt;br /&gt;
Angle Glaucoma, or the secondary open angle glaucomas, Pigmentary&lt;br /&gt;
Glaucoma and Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma. Patients with other causes of&lt;br /&gt;
secondary open angle glaucoma or angle closure glaucomas are not eligible&lt;br /&gt;
for use of this device. Patients’ IOP should be controlled on 1–3 glaucoma&lt;br /&gt;
medications and patients should not previously have had surgery for glaucoma.&lt;br /&gt;
FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later&lt;br /&gt;
than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the&lt;br /&gt;
background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background&lt;br /&gt;
material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web&lt;br /&gt;
site after the meeting. Background material is available at http://www.fda.gov/&lt;br /&gt;

of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably&lt;br /&gt;
