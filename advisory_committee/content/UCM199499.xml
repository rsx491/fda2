[Docket No. FDA–2010–N–0001]&lt;br /&gt;
The Neurological Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee;&lt;br /&gt;
Notice of Meeting&lt;br /&gt;
AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.&lt;br /&gt;
ACTION: Notice.&lt;br /&gt;
This notice announces a forthcoming meeting of a public advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The meeting will be&lt;br /&gt;
open to the public.&lt;br /&gt;
Name of Committee: Neurological Devices Panel of the Medical Devices&lt;br /&gt;
Advisory Committee.&lt;br /&gt;
General Function of the Committee: To provide advice and&lt;br /&gt;
recommendations to the agency on FDA’s regulatory issues.&lt;br /&gt;
Date and Time: The meeting will be held on March 12, 2010, from 8 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;
to 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Location: Hilton Washington DC North/Gaithersburg, Salons A, B, C, and&lt;br /&gt;
D, 620 Perry Pkwy., Gaithersburg, MD.&lt;br /&gt;
Contact Person: Deborah Falls, Center for Devices and Radiological Health,&lt;br /&gt;
Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD&lt;br /&gt;
20993–0002, or FDA Advisory Committee Information Line, 1–800–741–8138&lt;br /&gt;
(301–443–0572 in the Washington, DC area), code 3014512513. Please call the&lt;br /&gt;
Information Line for up-to-date information on this meeting. A notice in the&lt;br /&gt;
Federal Register about last minute modifications that impact a previously&lt;br /&gt;
announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly&lt;br /&gt;
enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the&lt;br /&gt;
agency’s Web site and call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone&lt;br /&gt;
line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Agenda: On March 12, 2010, the committee will discuss, make&lt;br /&gt;
recommendations, and vote on a premarket approval application for the Deep&lt;br /&gt;
Brain Stimulation System for Epilepsy sponsored by Medtronic, Inc. This&lt;br /&gt;
device is indicated as adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency of seizures&lt;br /&gt;
in individuals diagnosed with epilepsy. For this device, a patient’s epilepsy&lt;br /&gt;
should be characterized by partial-onset seizures (affecting only a part of the&lt;br /&gt;
brain when they begin), with or without secondary generalization that are&lt;br /&gt;
refractory to antiepileptic medications. ‘‘Secondary generalization’’ is used to&lt;br /&gt;
describe a partial-onset seizure that later spreads to the whole brain.&lt;br /&gt;
‘‘Refractory’’ to antiepileptic medications means that the patient’s epilepsy&lt;br /&gt;
does not respond to approved medications.&lt;br /&gt;
FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later&lt;br /&gt;
than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the&lt;br /&gt;
background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background&lt;br /&gt;
material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web&lt;br /&gt;
site after the meeting. Background material is available at http://www.fda.gov/&lt;br /&gt;
AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm. Scroll down to the appropriate&lt;br /&gt;
advisory committee link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Procedure: Interested persons may present data, information, or views,&lt;br /&gt;
orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee. Written&lt;br /&gt;
submissions may be made to the contact person on or before March 5, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled at approximately 1 p.m.,&lt;br /&gt;
immediately following lunch. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations&lt;br /&gt;
should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general&lt;br /&gt;
nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and&lt;br /&gt;
addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time&lt;br /&gt;
requested to make their presentation on or before February 25, 2010. Time&lt;br /&gt;
allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants&lt;br /&gt;
requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during&lt;br /&gt;
the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to&lt;br /&gt;
determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The&lt;br /&gt;
contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak&lt;br /&gt;
by February 26, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
