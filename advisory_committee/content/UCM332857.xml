The Department of Health and Human Services received a request from the Drug Enforcement Administration for a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation for these products in response to continued reports of misuse, abuse and addiction related to these products. The committee will also discuss the impact of rescheduling these hydrocodone products from Schedule III to Schedule II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background materials for the originally scheduled October 29-30, 2012, Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee meeting are currently available at: &lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM307385')--]"&gt;2012 Meeting Materials, Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the January 24 and 25, 2013, Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee meeting.
