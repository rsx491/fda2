The committee will also consider the efficacy of ESI and the overall risk benefit balance of injecting steroids in the epidural space to treat pain. These considerations will assist the Agency in our discussions of possible regulatory options, including but not limited to changes to the product labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.

If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by October 31, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p sizcache="1" sizset="44"&gt;CDER plans to provide a free of charge, live webcast of the November 24 and 25, 2014, meeting of the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee.
