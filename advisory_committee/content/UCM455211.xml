&lt;h4&gt;Agenda&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Science Board will be provided with a report from the Commissioner&amp;rsquo;s Fellowship Program Evaluation subcommittee and will be provided with a progress report from the Science Looking Forward subcommittee. The Board will hear an overview of two scientific activities from the Center for Veterinary Medicine and will be asked to provide input on strategies to implement targeted directives contained in the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, designed to guide action by public health, healthcare, and veterinary partners in a common effort to address urgent and serious drug-resistant threats that affect people in the U.S. and around the world. A recipient of one of the FY2014 Scientific Achievement Awards (selected by the Board) will provide an overview of the activities for which the award was given. A status update on the 21st Century Cures Act will be presented, and the Deputy Commissioner for Medical Products and Tobacco will discuss his vision for the Office of Medical Products and Tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make the complete background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM431539')--]"&gt;Background material&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Participation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before July 22, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 2:45 and 3:45 PM. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before July 22, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session.
