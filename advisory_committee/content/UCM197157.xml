Information Line for up-to-date information on this meeting. A notice in the&lt;br /&gt;
Federal Register about last minute modifications that impact a previously&lt;br /&gt;
announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly&lt;br /&gt;
enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the&lt;br /&gt;
agency’s Web site and call the appropriate advisory committee hot line/phone&lt;br /&gt;
line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Agenda: On March 5, 2010, the committee will discuss and make&lt;br /&gt;
recommendations regarding clinical risks and benefits of post-market actions&lt;br /&gt;
in response to insulin pump failures. Insulin pumps are intended for&lt;br /&gt;
continuous delivery of insulin at set and variable rates and as an aid in the&lt;br /&gt;
management of diabetes mellitus in persons requiring insulin.&lt;br /&gt;
FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later&lt;br /&gt;
than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the&lt;br /&gt;
background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background&lt;br /&gt;
material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory&lt;br /&gt;
committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web&lt;br /&gt;
site after the meeting. Background material is available at http://www.fda.gov/&lt;br /&gt;
AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm. Scroll down to the appropriate&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Procedure: Interested persons may present data, information, or views,&lt;br /&gt;
orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee. Written&lt;br /&gt;
submissions may be made to the contact person on or before February 22, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled immediately following&lt;br /&gt;
lunch. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the&lt;br /&gt;
contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the&lt;br /&gt;
evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of&lt;br /&gt;
proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested&lt;br /&gt;
to make their presentation on or before February 11, 2010. Time allotted for&lt;br /&gt;
each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to&lt;br /&gt;
speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled&lt;br /&gt;
open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the&lt;br /&gt;
speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person&lt;br /&gt;
will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by February 12,&lt;br /&gt;
2010.&lt;/p&gt;
