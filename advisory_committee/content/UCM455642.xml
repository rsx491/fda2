The system, originally approved in November 2002, under P020014, consists of a delivery system and nickel-containing permanent implants. The implants are placed without a skin incision, through the vagina, within each fallopian tube; they elicit tissue ingrowth, which over time results in tubal occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA is convening this committee to seek expert scientific and clinical opinion on the risks and benefits of the Essure System. The committee will be asked to evaluate currently available scientific data pertaining to the safety and effectiveness of the Essure System, such as events related to implant perforation/migration, device removal, chronic pain, allergic reactions, and unintended pregnancy. The committee will be asked to provide recommendations regarding appropriate device use, product labeling, and potential need for additional postmarket clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&amp;nbsp; Background material is available at &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;.
