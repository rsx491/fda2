The proposed indication (use) for this product is as a single agent treatment for patients with recurring or refractory (difficult to treat), aggressive non-Hodgkin&amp;rsquo;s lymphoma (NHL) who have received two or more prior lines of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the afternoon session, the committee will discuss NDA 022-374, proposed trade name OMAPRO (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) for injection, manufactured by ChemGenex Pharmaceuticals. The proposed indication (use) for this product is for the treatment of adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) bearing a genetic alteration known as the Bcr-Abl T315I mutation, and who have failed prior therapy with the drug imatinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the postponement of the February 10, 2010, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting because of severe weather conditions and the urgency to reschedule this meeting, FDA regrets that it was unable to publish this notice 15 days prior to the March 22, 2010, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting. Because the agency believes there is some urgency to bring these issues to public discussion and because of the availability of qualified members of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee on this date, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs concluded that it was in the public interest to hold this meeting even if there was not sufficient time for the customary 15-day public notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background materials from the originally scheduled February 10, 2010, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting are currently available at: &lt;a href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','ucm195226.htm')--]"&gt;2010 Meeting Materials, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Should any additional b&lt;span style="color: black"&gt;ackground materials become available, they will be posted two days ahead of the March 22, 2010 meeting at this same Web site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before March 17, 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., and 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. on March 22nd.
