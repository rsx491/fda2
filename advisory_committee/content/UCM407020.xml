&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Food Advisory Committee will discuss risk ranking and risk prioritization approaches for specific regulatory purposes. The Committee will provide input to FDA in the development of the characteristics for data collections and risk ranking/risk prioritization models. These characteristics would be useful in framing the fundamental elements needed to design or evaluate FDA's food and veterinary programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The background materials will be posted at least five days before the meeting start date.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before September 22, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on September 30, 2014. Those individuals interested in making formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before September 12, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by September 15, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
