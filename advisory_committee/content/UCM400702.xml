&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Hilton Washington DC North/Gaithersburg, Salons A, B, C, and D, 620 Perry Pkwy., Gaithersburg, MD 20877. The hotel's telephone number is 301-977-8900.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Person&lt;/strong&gt;: Sara Anderson, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, rm. 1643, Silver Spring MD 20993-0002, &lt;a href="mailto:Sara.Anderson@fda.hhs.gov"&gt;Sara.Anderson@fda.hhs.gov&lt;/a&gt;, 301-796-7047, or FDA Advisory Committee Information Line, 1-800-741-8138 (301-443-0572 in the Washington, DC area). A notice in the Federal Register about last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the Agency's Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to the appropriate advisory committee meeting link, or call the advisory committee information line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;: On July 30, 2014, the committee will discuss, make recommendations, and vote on information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) for the Ablatherm Integrated Imaging device sponsored by EDAP Technomed, Inc. The proposed Indication for Use for the Ablatherm Integrated Imaging device, as stated in the PMA, is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Ablatherm Integrated Imaging device is intended for the primary treatment of prostate cancer in subjects with low risk, localized prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;On July 31, 2014, the committee will discuss and make recommendations regarding the classification of Penile Tumescence Monitors, Nephrostomy Catheters, Stimulators for Electrical Sperm Collection, Erectile Dysfunction Devices, and Alloplastic Spermatoceles. These devices are considered preamendments devices since they were in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976, when the Medical Devices Amendments became effective. Penile Tumescence Monitors are currently regulated under the heading, &amp;quot;Monitor, Penile Tumescence,&amp;quot; Product Code LIL, as unclassified under the 510(k) premarket notification authority. Nephrostomy Catheters are currently regulated under the heading, &amp;quot;Catheter, Nephrostomy,&amp;quot; Product Code LJE, as unclassified under the 510(k) premarket notification authority. Stimulators for Electrical Sperm Collection are currently regulated under the heading, &amp;quot;Stimulator, Electrical for Sperm Collection,&amp;quot; Product Code LNL, as unclassified under the 510(k) premarket notification authority. Erectile Dysfunction Devices are currently regulated under the heading, &amp;quot;Device, Erectile Dysfunction,&amp;quot; Product Code LST, as unclassified under the 510(k) premarket notification authority. Alloplastic Spermatoceles are currently regulated under the heading, &amp;quot;Spermatocele, Alloplastic,&amp;quot; Product Code LQS, as unclassified under the 510(k) premarket notification authority. FDA is seeking committee input on the safety and effectiveness and the regulatory classification of Penile Tumescence Monitors, Nephrostomy Catheters, Stimulators for Electrical Sperm Collection, Erectile Dysfunction Devices, and Alloplastic Spermatoceles.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting. Background material is available at &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/&lt;br&gt;MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to the appropriate advisory committee meeting link.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
