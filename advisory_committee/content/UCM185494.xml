A notice in the Federal Register about last minute modifications that&lt;br /&gt;impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be&lt;br /&gt;published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should&lt;br /&gt;always check the agency&amp;rsquo;s Web site and call the appropriate advisory&lt;br /&gt;committee hot line/phone line to learn about possible modifications before&lt;br /&gt;coming to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda: On November 4, 2009, the committee will discuss, make&lt;br /&gt;recommendations and vote on a premarket approval application for the&lt;br /&gt;Dynesys Spinal System, sponsored by Zimmer Spine.

If FDA is unable to post the&lt;br /&gt;background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background&lt;br /&gt;material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory&lt;br /&gt;committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web&lt;br /&gt;site after the meeting. Background material is available on the FDA Internet&lt;br /&gt;under the appropriate date at http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/&lt;br /&gt;Calendar/default.htm.
