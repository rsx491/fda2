The two proposed indications (uses) for this product are: (1) first-line treatment of a subgroup of women with metastatic breast cancer known as HER2-negative breast cancer, in combination with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel; and (2) first-line treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in combination with one of two classes of chemotherapy drugs, known as taxanes and anthracyclines, or with the chemotherapy drug, capecitabine. In addition to the discussion of these two indications, the committee will also consider the impact of the submitted studies on the conversion from accelerated to regular approval of the indication for the treatment, in combination with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, of patients who have not received chemotherapy for their locally recurrent or metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.
