A lower PCA3 score is associated with a decreased likelihood of a positive biopsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.&amp;nbsp; Background material is available at &lt;a href="[!--$wcmUrl('nodelink','2044')--]" target=""&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;.
