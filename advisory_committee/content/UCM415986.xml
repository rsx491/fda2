&lt;p&gt;The committee will discuss new drug application (NDA) 206316, edoxaban tablets, submitted by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (blood clots other than in the head) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (A Fib; abnormally rapid and chaotic contractions of the atria, the upper chambers of the heart).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h5&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h5&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h5&gt;Background Material&lt;/h5&gt;&#13;

&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;h5&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h5&gt;&#13;
&lt;div&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul sizcache="5" sizset="27"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before October 16, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on October 30, 2014. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before October 7, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by October 8, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
