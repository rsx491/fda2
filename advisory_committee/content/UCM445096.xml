In addition, the committee will discuss the safety and efficacy of evolocumab to reduce LDL-C, TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C, in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g. statins, LDL apheresis) in patients at least 12 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.
