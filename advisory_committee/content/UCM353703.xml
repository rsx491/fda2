A notice in the Federal Register about last minute modifications that impact a previously announced advisory committee meeting cannot always be published quickly enough to provide timely notice. Therefore, you should always check the Agency's Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/default.htm&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to the appropriate advisory committee meeting link, or call the advisory committee information line to learn about possible modifications before coming to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;: On June 26, 2013, the committee will discuss and make recommendations regarding the possible reclassification of blood lancet devices. The committee will discuss whether new scientific data are sufficient to support the reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness to develop special controls that support regulation of blood lancets from class I to class II and class III. The four subsets of blood lancets have been identified with the following indications for use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood lancet with an integral sharps injury prevention feature is for single use only, disposable blood lancet with a blade attached to a solid base which includes an integral sharps injury prevention feature that allows the device to be used once and then renders it inoperable and incapable of further use and which is used to puncture the skin to obtain a drop of blood for diagnostic purposes;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood lancet without an integral sharps injury prevention feature is for single use only, disposable blood lancet with a blade attached to a solid base which is used to puncture the skin to obtain a drop of blood for diagnostic purposes;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood lancet for single patient use only is a multiple use capable blood lancet with a single use blade inserted into a solid, reusable base which is used only for a single patient to puncture the skin to obtain a drop of blood for diagnostic purposes; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiple use blood lancet for multiple patient use is a multiple use capable blood lancet with a single use blade inserted into a solid, reusable base which is used for multiple patients to puncture the skin to obtain a drop of blood for diagnostic purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.
