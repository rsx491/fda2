&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee will discuss the efficacy and safety of new drug application (NDA) 21–242, artesunate rectal suppositories, submitted by the World Health Organization, for the proposed use as a single dose for the initial treatment of patients with acute malaria who cannot take medication by mouth and for whom injectable treatment is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA’s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
