&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will discuss supplemental new drug application (sNDA) 202439/S-002, rivaroxaban, trade name XARELTO 2.5 milligram tablets, submitted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the proposed indication to reduce the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients in the first 90 days after suffering acute coronary syndrome [ST elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina].&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Background Material&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;

&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul sizcache="5" sizset="27"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before January 9, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on January 16, 2014. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before January 3, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by January 6, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
