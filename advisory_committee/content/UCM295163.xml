The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has submitted efficacy data for ciprofloxacin, based on treatment in an animal model of plague.  Safety and other supportive information is derived from clinical studies and post-marketing experience in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On April 4, 2012, the committee will discuss the data provided to support the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin for the treatment of pneumonic plague in humans.  Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, LLC (on behalf of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) has submitted efficacy supplements for Levaquin (levofloxacin) tablets, injection, and oral solution (NDA 20-634, NDA 20-635, and NDA 21-721, respectively) for treatment of pneumonic plague.  Efficacy data for levofloxacin is based on treatment in an animal model of plague.  Safety and other supportive information is derived from clinical studies and post-marketing experience in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.
