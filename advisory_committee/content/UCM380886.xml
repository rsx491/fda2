&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The committees will discuss data submitted by Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to support a new drug application (NDA) 205920, for over-the-counter (OTC) marketing of epinephrine inhalation aerosol 125 microgram (mcg)/actuation (proposed trade name Primatene HFA), for temporary relief of mild symptoms of intermittent asthma for consumers 12 years of age and older. The epinephrine inhaler was developed as a replacement for Primatene Mist (epinephrine metered inhaler 200 mcg/actuation), an OTC product that was phased out in December 2011 because of the use of chlorofluorocarbons as the propellant. The committee will be asked to consider whether the data support an acceptable risk/benefit profile of the epinephrine inhaler for use by OTC consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul sizset="27" sizcache="5"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before February 10, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. on February 25, 2014. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before January 31, 2014.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited.
