&lt;h3&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 30, 2010, the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee will cover the following two topics: (Topic 1) Receive presentations on the background and overview of the FDA Center for Tobacco Products, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the Tobacco Control Act), and the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee; and (Topic 2) receive presentations on and discuss the published literature on menthol as it relates to the demographics of users, preferential use by persons initiating&lt;br /&gt;
tobacco use, the health effects of menthol in cigarettes, the effects of menthol on addiction and cessation, marketing and consumer perceptions about menthol cigarettes, the sensory qualities of menthol cigarettes, and the effects of menthol on how cigarettes are smoked. On March 31, 2010, the Committee will continue the presentations and discussions of topic 2; and also receive preliminary information about topics planned for discussion at future&lt;br /&gt;
meetings, including an action plan designed to ensure the enforcement of restrictions required by the Tobacco Control Act on the advertising and promotion of menthol and other cigarettes to youth, and the establishment of a list of harmful and potentially harmful tobacco product constituents, including smoke constituents. These discussions are preliminary to the preparation of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee’s required report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding the impact of use of menthol in cigarettes on the public’s health. A second meeting of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, focusing on tobacco industry research and documents related to menthol and cigarettes, is planned for summer 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
