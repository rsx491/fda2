The proposed indication (use) for EGRIFTA in this application is to induce and maintain a reduction of excess visceral abdominal fat in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with lipodystrophy (a condition in which abnormal deposits of fat are seen partly as a result of using certain drugs to treat HIV disease).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="[!--$ssLink(&amp;quot;ucm191113.htm&amp;quot;)--]"&gt;Background Material&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before February 17, 2010.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., February 24, 2010.
