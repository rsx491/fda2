Codeine (most often in combination with acetaminophen) is used for the treatment of pain in children; however, it is contraindicated for the management of pain after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Codeine (in combination with other medicines) is used for the relief of cough associated with upper respiratory allergies or the common cold in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codeine is available by prescription and also through the over-the-counter (OTC) Drug Monograph for Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products (21 CFR 341.14, 21 CFR 341.74, and 21 CFR 341.90).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of the meeting will be the risk of serious adverse events, such as respiratory depression and death, including reports in children who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers. The committees will discuss whether the use of codeine in children should be restricted further beyond the current contraindication described previously and whether codeine should be available through the OTC Drug Monograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s Web site after the meeting. Background material is available at: &lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM433815')--]"&gt;2015 Meeting Materials, Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before November 24, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. on December 10, 2015. Those individuals interested in making formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before November 16, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. The contact person will notify interested persons regarding their request to speak by November 17, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Webcast Information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p sizcache="1" sizset="44"&gt;CDER plans to provide a free of charge, live webcast of the December 10, 2015, joint meeting of the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.
