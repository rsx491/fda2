(authorized U.S. agent).  The proposed indication (use) for this product is for the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload (excess iron in the body related to blood transfusions), when current chelation therapy is inadequate.  (Chelation therapy in these patients binds iron in a form that allows it to be eliminated from the body).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the afternoon session, the committee will consider the development of products for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have a rising serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) despite being on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). There are no products currently approved for this indication. No specific products will be presented or discussed; rather, the committee will be asked to consider possible trial designs and suitable clinical endpoints to establish efficacy that would support a labeled indication for treatment of non-metastatic CRPC after PSA progression on ADT. Because ADT is an unproven therapy for this condition with serious long-term toxicity, the committee will be asked whether approval of a new therapy in conjunction with continued ADT would be appropriate for patients with non-metastatic CRPC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Materials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FDA intends to make background material available  to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting.&amp;nbsp; If FDA is  unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the  background material will be made publicly available at the location of the  advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA&amp;rsquo;s  Web site after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background material:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="" href="[!--$wcmUrl('link','UCM235829')--]"&gt;2011 Meeting Materials, Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Participation Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in  writing, on issues pending before the committee.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Written submissions may be made to the contact person on or before August 30,  2011.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Oral presentations from the public will be scheduled between approximately 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Those desiring to make formal oral presentations should notify the contact person and submit a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time requested to make their presentation on or before August 22, 2011.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div&gt;Time allotted for each presentation may be limited.  If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the    scheduled open public hearing session.
